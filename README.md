My project aims to examine whether an increase in service charges by banks after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) in 2008 have a statistically significant impact on the number of respondents who say they cannot open a bank account because of costs.

After the GFC, banks rely more heavily on service charges (such as overdraft fees, ATM fees, income from the sales of checks, safe deposit box fees, wire transfer fees and card charges) due to the collapse in securitization fees and stricter regulations. The increase in service fees might have harmed financial inclusion. In 2019, 5.4 percent of US households were unbanked, meaning that no one in the household had a checking or savings account at a bank or credit union (FDIC 2020). Nearly one-third of them cite fees that are too high as a reason for being unbanked. By examining whether and to what extent the increase in bank fees impacts financial inclusion, I want to contribute to the debate on the effectiveness of the cap on fees currently under consideration.
