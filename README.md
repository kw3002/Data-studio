My project aims to examine whether a constant increase in service charges by banks after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) in 2008 has a statistically significant impact on the bank account ownership rate.

# Bacnground
After the GFC, banks rely more heavily on service charges (ATM fees, income from the sales of checks, safe deposit box fees, wire transfer fees and card charges) due to the collapse in securitization fees and stricter regulations(Joseph G. Haubrich and Tristan Young, "Trends in the Noninterest Income of Banks"). The increase in service fees might have harmed financial inclusion. In 2019, 5.4 percent of US households were unbanked, meaning that no one in the household had a checking or savings account at a bank or credit union (FDIC 2020). Nearly one-third of them cite fees that are too high as a reason for being unbanked. By examining whether and to what extent the increase in bank fees impacts financial inclusion, I want to contribute to the debate on the effectiveness of the cap on fees currently under consideration.

# Data
# 1.Bank fee data
I use survey data by Bankrate (Matthew Goldberg, "Survey: Free checking accounts on the rise as total ATM fees fall"). Three types of bank cost data can be obtained from Bankrate: (1) Average monthly service fee for interest accounts, (2) Average monthly service fee for non-interest accounts, and (3) Average annual overdraft fee.

2.Bank Account Holding Ratio Data
The following two data sets were used as the bank account ownership percentage data sources.
